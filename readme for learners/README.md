# Learn How This Weather App Works

Welcome! This guide is for **beginners and students** who want to understand how to build a real-world weather app using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.


## What You'll Learn
- HTML/CSS -Basic
- How to connect to weather APIs
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Working with user location
- Rendering dynamic content with real data

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Get Coordinates from City Name

We use the **Geocoding API** to convert a city name into geographic coordinates:

```
http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=CityName&limit=1&appid=API_KEY
```

➡️ This returns latitude and longitude for the city.

### 2. Get Weather Forecast

Then we use the **Weather Forecast API** to fetch weather data:

```
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat=...&lon=...&appid=API_KEY
```

➡️ This gives a 5-day forecast in 3-hour intervals. We filter the data to show **1 forecast per day**.

### 3. JavaScript Highlights

- `fetch()` – To make API calls
- `querySelector()` – To access elements in the HTML
- `addEventListener()` – To respond to user interactions (button clicks)
- `innerHTML` / `insertAdjacentHTML()` – To display content dynamically
- `navigator.geolocation` – To get user's location using the browser

---

##  Key Concepts Used

- **API Integration** – Communicating with external services
- **DOM Manipulation** – Adding and updating content in the browser
- **Asynchronous JavaScript** – Using promises with `fetch()`
- **User Input Validation** – Checking input before sending to the API
- **Geolocation API** – Detecting and using current user location

---

##  Try It Yourself

1. Get a **free API key** from [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)

2. Replace the `API_KEY` placeholder in `script.js`:

```js
const API_KEY = "your_api_key_here";
```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

---

##  Project Flow Summary

1. User enters a city or clicks "Use My Location"
2. App gets coordinates (lat/lon)
3. App fetches 5-day forecast using those coordinates
4. Forecast is displayed with icons, temperature, wind speed, and humidity

##  What You Can Add (Advanced Practice)
-  Dark/Light mode
-  °C ↔ °F toggle
-  Weather background images
- ⌨ Autocomplete city names
-  Refresh button
